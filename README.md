## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS and DOM manipulation

### What I learned

I have never collaborated on a programming project before this project, and I learned a lot about collaboration. I got better at using Git and the command line. I also improved my CSS and working with background images, which has been a challenge in the past.

### Continued development

I would love to keep collaborating as it's super exciting and fun to be working in a team.
